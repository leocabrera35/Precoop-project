/* The first rule makes each div.POPOSSpace expand to the width
 of its grid cell. The width of the grid container is a percentage
  of the window width, so these cells expand and contract with the window. */

/* The second rule sets the width img tags within the div.POPOSSpace to
 100% of the available space. With this, the images match the width
  of their container. The second property here height: auto makes
   images maintain their aspect ratio as they scale. */
